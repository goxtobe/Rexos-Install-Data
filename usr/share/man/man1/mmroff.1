.SH NAME
mmroff \- cross reference preprocessor
.SH SYNOPSIS
.B mmroff
[
.I -x
]
.I groff_arguments
.SH DESCRIPTION
\fBmmroff\fP is a simple preprocessor for \fBgroff\fP, it is
used for expanding cross references in \fBmm\fP, see
\fBgroff_mm(7)\fP.
\fBgroff\fP is executed twice, first with \fB-z\fP and \fB-rRef=1\fR
to collect all cross references and then to do the real processing
when the cross reference file is up to date.
.TP
\fB\-x\fR
Just create the cross reference file.
This can be used to refresh the cross reference file,
it isn't always needed to have accurate
cross references and by using this option \fBgroff\fP will only
be run once.
